# Day 0 — 12 February 2026

## What I shipped
- Installed dev environment: Homebrew, OrbStack, VS Code, iTerm2, Rectangle
- Configured Git with Ed25519 SSH key + signed commits
- Installed pre-commit + gitleaks for secret leak prevention
- Rewrote GitHub profile README: rebranded for Detection Engineering focus
- Created learning-journal repo

## What I learned
- Signed commits add a "Verified" badge — signals integrity verification to employers
- OrbStack uses ~1.1GB RAM vs Docker Desktop's 3-4GB — critical on 8GB machine
- GitHub profile README is a special repo (same name as username) that displays on your profile page

## What confused me
- (Nothing major today — setup day)

## Tomorrow's focus
- Install gitleaks pre-commit hook on all repos
- Start TryHackMe Pre-Security path
- First networking fundamentals (OSI model, DNS, HTTP)
